## Native cloumn

If English is not your first language, it’s recommended to translate words into your native language. For this, in almost all SBS Anki decks there is an empty field called "native" that you can fill in.

We are happy to provide additional data for Russian and Chinese languages. Download the CSV files below and import them into most SBS decks. Note that the deck must have a "native" field:

- [sbs_russian.csv](https://github.com/sasanarakkha/study-tools/releases/latest/download/sbs-rus.csv)

<!-- - [sbs_chinese.csv](https://github.com/sasanarakkha/study-tools/releases/latest/download/sbs-chi.csv) -->

- Let us know if you need another language. These days, GPT can automatically translate many languages with quite good quality.

The update process is a bit different since these CSV files contain all words related to all SBS decks in a single file.

- in Anki, click on **File > Import**

- Select the downloaded CSV file.

- Choose the Notetype and Deck you wish to update.

- Scroll down to the beginning of the **Field Mapping** section and switch the positions of *pali* and *native*, so that *native* maps to the second column in the CSV file, while *pali* remains unmapped (Nothing).

- Double-check everything with the image above, then click  **import**

- In the window **Overview**, you’ll see that along with updated existing cards, many new notes have been imported. We need to remove these. Click on **Show** to display the new notes.
