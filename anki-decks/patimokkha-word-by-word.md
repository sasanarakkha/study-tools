# Pātimokkha Word By Word - Anki deck

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is the word by word analysis of the Dvemātikāpāḷi Bhikkhupātimokkha, the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana edition: [DPR](https://www.digitalpalireader.online/_dprhtml/index.html?loc=v.6.0.x.x.x.x.t) or [Suttacentral](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-pm/pli/ms?layout=plain&reference=cck/pts/vri&notes=asterisk&highlight=true&script=latin)

It is recommended to study this pack together with the [Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/vinaya/pli-tv-vi/pli-tv-bu-vb) and The Bhikkhu Patimokkha - Word by Word Translation by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita.

Analysis of the Bhikkhupātimokkha you can see and comment [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rS-IlX4DvKmnBO58KON37eVnOZqwfkG-ot-zIjCuzH4/).

or use analysis in [HTML](https://devamitta.github.io/patimokkha_dict/Bhikkhu_Patimokkha/main.html) format.

You can use [second sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rS-IlX4DvKmnBO58KON37eVnOZqwfkG-ot-zIjCuzH4/edit#gid=1448457199) of that analisis as an exercise book.

If you want to understand the Pātimokkha rules more deeply, you can use the [Anki deck of Vibhaṅga](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/anki-decks/vibhanga.html), which contains pāli words from definitions of Pātimokkha words.

It is available for testing and [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG6zKDtlwibtrX-cbKVn4WmIs8miH4VnuJvb7f94plCDKJyA/viewform), thanks to Venerable Bodhirasa.

# Review or study words that meet specific criteria

Create a **Custom study** for current deck

![2024-10-26_12-11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/477d0703-9eec-4835-b07a-4a327b19375b)

The idea is to create any **Custom study** for now. For example choose *Study by card state", and simply click "OK" without selecting any tags.

![2024-10-26_12-12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6397b4fb-0bbd-4758-825c-9367f6c28bc0)

Go to **Option** of this **Custom study** and adjust the *search* fieldto find the words you need, for example: 

`"deck:Pali Patimokkha Word By Word" abbrev:NI`

![2024-10-26_12-12_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bd39339-b3cb-4261-ab4d-a4ef28d4a42e)

This will filter all words from the current deck that are from Nidāna

After finishing your study, don't forget to "Empty" this deck. This will return all cards to the original deck and keep the statistics.

Or watch [small video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acff310b-463e-4c24-854d-d7006994d239) how to do that

# Updating existing deck without losing your statistics

!Important! Before doing anything, synchronize your collection across all your Anki devices. Go to **Tools > Preferences > Syncing** and enable "*On next sync force changes in one direction*". This will provide a secure backup on the Anki cloud in case of any issues.

It is recommended to use [Special fields Add-on](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/special-fields.html)

Please see a small [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39419221/187018792-3afe402c-e77b-46e6-ba5d-4efa0846de93.mp4) how to update.

Or just follow the description:

Usually it is enough just to double-click on the downloaded apkg file, and it will update in your Anki. 

Only you need to [remove outdated words](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/anki-decks/test.html)

If English is not your first language, it is recommended to translate words on your native language. For this, a field called "native" has been added that you can fill. And even with next update, this field still will keep all your info.

# Another method of updating
