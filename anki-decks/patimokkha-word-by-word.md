UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is the word by word analysis of the Dvemātikāpāḷi Bhikkhupātimokkha, the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana edition: [DPR](https://www.digitalpalireader.online/_dprhtml/index.html?loc=v.6.0.x.x.x.x.t) or [Suttacentral](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-pm/pli/ms?layout=plain&reference=cck/pts/vri&notes=asterisk&highlight=true&script=latin)

It is recommended to study this pack together with the [Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/vinaya/pli-tv-vi/pli-tv-bu-vb) and The Bhikkhu Patimokkha - Word by Word Translation by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita.

If you want to understand the Pātimokkha rules more deeply, you can use the [Anki deck of Vibhaṅga](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/anki-decks/vibhanga.html), which contains pāli words from definitions of Pātimokkha words.

It is available for testing and [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG6zKDtlwibtrX-cbKVn4WmIs8miH4VnuJvb7f94plCDKJyA/viewform), thanks to Venerable Bodhirasa.
