# Parittas - Anki Deck

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This tool is designed for memorizing words from a few traditional paritta chants. It is currently available for testing and [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNC5v2gQbBCM3giXfYIib9zrp-WMzwJuf_iVXEMX2re4BFFw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=SBS-study-tools). Make sure to regularly download the latest content here.

The chants can be studied using [SBS Pāḷi-English Recitations](https://sasanarakkha.org/2019/09/08/sbs-pali-english-recitations/)

Word by word analysis of those suttas can be found 
- [Ratana-sutta](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GE9J6Ws1ezWHxGQ5hJeFabPIoHONt7Gzrt86UNYNR4s/)
- [Karaṇīya-metta-sutta](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLTSvK02-i-V2EfiMOXs_z8X-Tf2as06dVe2AuYBREo/)
- [Khandha-parittaṃ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o2cDWXsgpJXm2d00woMNvsfk3Q35s5j9-DVV170bkgo/)

For easier memorization, can be helpful to use audio of those chants.

Always beneficial to keep [Digital Pāḷi Dictionary](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/) updated.
