# Recommended ways of studying this deck:

1) **Use the order of the Recitation Book.**

- Read analysis of the first chant. 
- Then study words from this chant. 
- After this, go to the next chant. 
- Better to go with order of the Recitation Book.

Benefits: you will cover all words consistently.

2) **Study chants that you are interested.**

Using this method you are at risk to lose some words, because they have been added in order of the Recitation Book, and if the word appear later it is not always added again.
- Read the analysis of the chant that you like to study. 
- in Anki go to **Browse**
