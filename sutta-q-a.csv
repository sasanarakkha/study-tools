What are the future perils?		1. Living alone in the forest one might die from a poisonous bite, fall down and die or become sick from food or bodily illness, encounter dangerous animals, encounter criminals, encounter wild spirits 2. I am now young but there will come a time when, old age assails the body, illness assails the body, almsfood is hard to obtain and people migrate to places where food is plenty and thus living conditions becomes congested, there is a time of discord among the population and they flee on all sides and living conditions become congested, there is schism in the Sangha. 3. Bhikkhus undeveloped in body, virtuous behavior, mind, and wisdom give full ordination are incapable of disciplining others. These disicplines in turn give ordination and are still unable to discipline the next generation. Undeveloped bhikkhus engaged in talk about the Dhamma will fall into dark Dhamma without recognizing it. Undeveloped bhikkhus do not listen and apply their minds with hearing the Tathāgata’s words but instead pay heed to poetry, beautiful words and phrases, created by outsiders, spoken by disciples. Elder bhikkhus will be luxurious and lax, leaders in backsliding, discarding the duty of solitude. Thus, bhikkhus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. 4. There will be bhikkhus who desire fine robes, fine almsfood, fine lodgings, to bond closely with female practitioners (resulting in living the spiritual life dissatisfied and committing a defiled offense) and monastery workers (thus engaging in use of various kinds of stored-up goods and gross hints).

If, with a razor-rimmed wheel, one were to make the living beings on this earth into one mass of flesh, into one heap of flesh, because of this there would be no evil and no outcome of evil.
