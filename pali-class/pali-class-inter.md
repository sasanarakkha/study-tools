We recommend using the latest [SBS Pali Dictionary](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/dict/sbs-pali-dictionary.html). All exercises and vocabulary used in the course are labeled in the dictionary, highlighting the intended meanings of words in specific course examples. Many helpful links lead directly to grammatical analysis.
