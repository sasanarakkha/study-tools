Originally created by Ven. Bodhirasa, this document has been updated and enhanced by the [Sāsanārakkha Buddhist Sanctuary](http://sasanarakkha.org/) Pāli Development panel under the guidance of Ven. Devamitta.

It includes the following sources:

- Analysis of the Bhikkhupātimokkha available in the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rS-IlX4DvKmnBO58KON37eVnOZqwfkG-ot-zIjCuzH4/).

- If you are using a mobile device, there is an [HTML version](https://devamitta.github.io/patimokkha_dict/Bhikkhu_Patimokkha/main.html) of the same analysis available.

# Exercises

For upcoming classes, you may practice analyzing the pātikokkha rules using the second sheet in the Google Sheet mentioned above. Please make a copy of this document rather than editing the original.

We recommend using the latest [SBS Pali Dictionary](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/dict/sbs-pali-dictionary.html). All exercises and vocabulary used in the course are labeled in the dictionary, highlighting the intended meanings of words in specific course examples. Many helpful links lead directly to grammatical analysis.
