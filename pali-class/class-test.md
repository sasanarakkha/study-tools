<h1>Removing duplicated words</h1>
<p>Please see small <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39419221/187020101-701ee57e-b708-4be1-91d7-0c9b411a11cd.mp4">video</a> how to do it.</p>
<p>This work is based on the <a href="https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/">DPD</a> dictionary which is a work in progress and being updated regularly. Because of this, from time to time may an updated may be done of selected words (this will show itself like this; for example: the word 'pada' will become 'pada 1', and variations of meanings of 'pada' will be added as 'pada 2', 'pada 3' etc.). </p>
<p>From this follows that from time to time duplicated words (the original 'pada' is now duplicated as 'pada 1', need to be removed. For this, the field called <strong>"Test"</strong> is used.</p>
<p>After you updated the downloaded Anki Deck (same way, just by double-clicking on the latest downloaded file). Choose your Deck and in the <strong>Browse</strong> add:</p>
<p><code>-test:</code>44</p>
<p>It will show all cards which do not have a number in field "Test". And you can easily delate all of this old words, by selecting all (<strong>Ctrl + A</strong>) and deleting (<strong>Ctrl + Delete</strong>). </p>
<p>Now you are up-to-date.</p>
<p>With every update, this number will be different.</p>
