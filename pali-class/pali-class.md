All these materials can be found on the SBS file server:

`\\FILESRV1\share1\Sharing between users\13 For Pāli class`

----

It is recommended to use the latest [SBS Pali Dictionary](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/dict/sbs-pali-dictionary.html). All exercises and words used in the course are specifically labelled in the dictionary as such, making it clear which particular meaning of words (if there are multiple) is intended in specific examples in the course.

It is also very useful to have an updated version of DPD, [Digital Pāḷi Dictionary](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/).

----

[Intermediate Pāli Course](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/pali-class/pali-class-inter.html) available for more advance Pāli students.
