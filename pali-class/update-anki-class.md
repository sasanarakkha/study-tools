# Updating existing deck without losing your statistics

!Important! Before doing anything, synchronize your collection across all your Anki devices. Go to **Tools > Preferences > Syncing** and enable "*On next sync force changes in one direction*". This will provide a secure backup on the Anki cloud in case of any issues.

# Special fields add-on
