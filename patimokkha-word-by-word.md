# Pātimokkha Word By Word - Anki deck

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is the Word By Word analysis of the [Dvemātikāpāḷi Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana edition](https://www.digitalpalireader.online/_dprhtml/index.html?loc=v.6.0.x.x.x.x.t) version of the Pātimokkha

This is a work in progress. Not all Pātimokkha rules covered yet, by every week covering few rules. So far covered up to PA 77. 

This work recommended to study together with the [Bhikkhu Vibhaṅga](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/vinaya/pli-tv-vi/pli-tv-bu-vb) and The Bhikkhu Patimokkha - Word by Word Translation by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita.
