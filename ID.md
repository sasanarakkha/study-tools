<h1>ID column</h1>

This is relevant to [update from 07.02.2023.](https://github.com/sasanarakkha/study-tools/releases/tag/artifacts-07.02.2023_12-59-44)

For convenience, we introduce new column `ID`

Now it is leading column, so no matter what changes we apply in the future, even in Pāli headword - you will receive all changes without any lost of progress in Anki.

But for now there are some steps required:

- In Anki go to Manage Note Type and choose Type of current Deck
- Click on Field
- Add new Field “ID” and place it straight after field “feedback”
- Download corresponding CSV with “ID after feedback” from [this folder.](https://github.com/sasanarakkha/study-tools/tree/main/ID%20after%20feedback)
- Import CSV
- [Remove duplicated words](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/test.html) or rename words (see list of words for renaming)
- Reposition ID column to the beginning, make it 1st field.
- Download corresponding CSV with “ID in the first position” from [this folder](https://github.com/sasanarakkha/study-tools/tree/main/ID%20in%20the%20first%20possition)
- To check import CSV
- The results “0 added, 0 updated, `many` unchanged” this is what you need hoping to see.
