# SBS Pāḷi Dictionary

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

A grammatical analysis of the words from the chanting book 'SBS Pāḷi-English Recitations' has been made available for testing and [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNC5v2gQbBCM3giXfYIib9zrp-WMzwJuf_iVXEMX2re4BFFw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=SBS-study-tools). It is a dictionary which runs in GoldenDict, or any other application that supports the Stardict format.

This tool is recommended to be used together with [SBS Pāḷi-English Recitations](https://github.com/sasanarakkha/pali-english-recitations/releases/tag/build_07.06.2023_04-24) and [Analysis of SBS Pāḷi-English Recitations](https://sasanarakkha.github.io/study-tools/anki-decks/sbs-per-analysis.html).
