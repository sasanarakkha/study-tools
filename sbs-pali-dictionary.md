# SBS Pāḷi Dictionary

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

A grammatical analysis of the words from the chanting book 'SBS Pāḷi-English Recitations' has been made available for public testing and [feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNC5v2gQbBCM3giXfYIib9zrp-WMzwJuf_iVXEMX2re4BFFw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1433863141=SBS-study-tools). It is a dictionary which runs in GoldenDict, or any other application that supports the Stardict format.
